# ub-webpagedemo-challenge
This project was centred around creating a portfolio to illustate the various projects I will  be working on in the coming weeks. I will be able to showcase my skills and talents to employers, making the journey into securing a developer role easier. 

With this project I will be  able to incorporate a lot of the concepts and skills I have learned so far on the course which include flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

From this challenge I have been able to develop my googlefoo skills, along woth connecting with some classmate on how to approach certain challenges. I still have a lot of the challene still commplete and will hopefully do so this week as I have more feww time in the coming days.
